1. I added names of images that is avaiable so that i can check if that name exists or not At utilities folder.
2. to run the app run the script "dev".
3. to run the test run the script "test".
4. to run the eslint for typescript run the script "lint".

5. **Test, Debug, and Refactor.**
   Think of edge-cases for your project and how someone may access your project. Should they get different error messages based on what's wrong? Make certain that your user isn't left in the dark when something goes wrong.
   - Do all of your tests still pass?
   - Does stopping and restarting your server cause any issues?
   - Does your user get feedback when something goes wrong?
   - Is your code easy to follow? Comments?
   - Is your API production-ready?
6. **Build, Document, and Submit.**
   If everything else has gone well, you should be able to compile your typescript and start up your production server to test that everything still works as expected. Make sure you've provided all necessary information in your readme file, so your reviewer knows how to test your API. If everything works and your documentation is complete, you're ready to submit!
   **_Congratulations!_**
