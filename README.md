2. to run the app run the script "dev".
3. to run the test run the script "test".
4. to run the eslint for typescript run the script "lint".
5. to access the endpoint for resizing the image first 'https://localhost:3000/api/images' then follow the instructions knowing that the names of avilable images in folder with path 'src\utilties\names.ts'
6. resizing the image is at this endpoint 'https://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=<name>&width=<width>&height=<height>'and it will send back the image with dims that you provided.
